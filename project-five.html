      <h2>yeti brew coffee, 2016</h2>
      <p>Yeti Brew Coffee is a personal project, encouraged by a late night, to explore illustration in package design. The main design feature is the window into the package, which is made by the Yetis forearms which are also based on the shape of a coffee bean. Between the graphics and content, this project was a lot of fun to create. </p>
